# POEM
Platform of Optimal Experimental Design (POEM)

An optimal experimental design platform powered with automated machine learning to automatically guides the design of experiment to be evaluated.

- Material thermal property modeling

- Design parameter optimization with multiple objectives

- Determining where to obtain new data in order to build accurate surrogate model

- Dynamic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis

- Model calibration through Bayesian inference

- Data adjustment through generalized linear least square method

- Machine learning aided parameter space exploration

- Bayesian optimization for optimal experimental design

- Pareto Frontier to guides the design of experiment to be evaluated

- Sparse grid stochastic collocation to accelerate experimental design
